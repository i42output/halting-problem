I hereby introduce the sNaP, the "signaling Not a Program" exception
to be raised in the event a [Strachey 1965] "Impossible Program" is
passed to a signaling halt decider.  The sNaP is analogous to the sNaN
of IEEE 754 floating point to signify the result of a mathematical
operation is undefined.

As an added bonus "sNaP" is quite catchy. :D
